The script 'WetDayPlotting.py' used to plot Figure 1 has been included, which can be adapted to plot Figure 3 and many of the Extended Data Figures. 

Data used in the journal manuscript 'When it rains, it pours: An unexplored relationship between wet day frequency and precipitation intensity distributions' is supplied as follows:

Main Figures
Figure 1: Subplot (a) was created using the .nc file '1980_2019_total_precipitation_masked' contaning the wet day frequency of ERA5 total precipitation as a function of latuitude and longitude. Subplot (b) was created using the .npy file 'total_precipitation_distribution' which contains the cumlative precipitation intensity distrubutions for each wet day frequency.

Figure 2: Each .npy file corresponds to the data used for each subplot.

Figure 3: Subplot (a) was created using the .nc file 'CAPE_distribution'. Subplot (b) was created using the .nc file 'w850_distribution'. Subplot (c) was created using the .npy file 'lsp_ratio'.


Extended Data Figures
Extended Data Figure 1: Each .npy file corresponds to the data used for each geographical/wet day frequency region for both the mean and standard deviation.

Extended Data Figure 2: Subplot (a) was created using the .nc file '1980_2019_total_precipitation_masked_0.5mm' contaning the wet day frequency of ERA5 total precipitation as a function of latuitude and longitude. Subplot (b) was created using the .npy file 'total_precipitation_distribution_0.5mm' which contains the cumlative precipitation intensity distrubutions for each wet day frequency.

Extended Data Figure 3: Subplot (a) was created using the .nc file '1980_2019_total_precipitation_masked_2mm' contaning the wet day frequency of ERA5 total precipitation as a function of latuitude and longitude. Subplot (b) was created using the .npy file 'total_precipitation_distribution_2mm' which contains the cumlative precipitation intensity distrubutions for each wet day frequency.

Extended Data Figure 4: Subplot (a) was created using the .npy file 'total_precipitation_distribution_ocean' and subplot (b) was created using the .npy file 'total_precipitation_distribution_land'

Extended Data Figure 5: Subplot (a) was created using the .npy file 'total_precipitation_distribution_ocean' and subplot (b) was created using the .npy file 'total_precipitation_distribution_land'

Extended Data Figure 6: Subplot (b) was created using the .npy file 'GHCN_Percentile_Data' and subplot (c) was created using the .npy file 'GHCN_Resampled_ERA5'

Extended Data Figure 7: Created using the .npy file 'coefficient_of_determination'

Extended Data Figure 8: Created using the .csv file 'correlation_matrix'

Extended Data Figure 9: Subplot (a) was created using the .nc file 'CAPE_frequency' and subplot (b) using the .nc file 'w850_frequency'. The .nc file 'era5_land_sea_mask' was used to mask subplot (a) and the .nc file 'ERA_total_precipitation_frequency' was used to plot the overlaid black contours on both subplots.
